# smk-bcparks
A simple map for BC Parks (replacement for DMF).

# Installation
BC Parks Simple map can be installed in 3 ways
1. deploying manually with any web server web folder e.g. Apache, IIS, NGINX
2. deploying a Docker container
3. deploying as replicaSet to OpenShift or kubernetes cluster

For small-scale production deployment or development, docker container will do fine. For large-scale production deployment requires horizontal scalability, the recommendation is one of 
* deploying as replicatSet to OpenShift or kubernetes cluster
* deploying manually with production ready web server web folder e.g. Apache, IIS, NGINX

## Deploying manually with any web server web folder
### system requirement
* any http web server, e.g. Apache, IIS, NGINX
* git
### deployment
```
 $ git clone  https://github.com/bcgov/smk-bcparks.git .
 $ cp bcparks ${WWW_folder} 
``` 
#### where ${WWW_folder} is the location served by your web server

## Deploying a Docker container
```
 $ git clone  https://github.com/bcgov/smk-bcparks.git
 $ cd smk-bcparks
 $ docker build -t bcparks .
 $ docker run -p 8080:8080 bcparks
``` 
## Deploying as replicaSet to OpenShift
``` 
 $ oc new-app https://github.com/bcgov/smk-bcparks.git --strategy=docker
 $ oc expose svc/smk-bcparks --hostname=bcparks.apps.gov.bc.ca
 #following step only required if need to create TLS
 $ oc create route edge --service=smk-bcparks --port=8080-tcp --hostname=bcparks.apps.gov.bc.ca
