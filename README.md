# smk-bcparks
A simple map for BC Parks (replacement for DMF).

# Installation
BC Parks Simple map can be installed in 3 ways
1. deploying manually with any web server web folder e.g. Apache, IIS, NGINX
2. deploying a Docker container
3. deploying as replicaSet to OpenShift or kubernetes cluster

For small-scale production deployment or development, docker container will do fine. For large-scale production deployment requires horizontal scalability, the recommendation is one of 
* deploying as replicatSet to OpenShift or kubernetes cluster
* deploying manually with production ready web server web folder e.g. Apache, IIS, NGINX

## Deploying manually with any web server web folder
### system requirement
* any http web server, e.g. Apache, IIS, NGINX
* git
### deployment
```
 $ git clone  https://github.com/bcgov/smk-bcparks.git .
 $ cp bcparks ${WWW_folder} 
``` 
#### where ${WWW_folder} is the location served by your web server

## Deploying a Docker container
```
 $ git clone  https://github.com/bcgov/smk-bcparks.git
 $ cd smk-bcparks
 $ docker build -t bcparks .
 $ docker run -p 8080:8080 bcparks
``` 
## Deploying as replicaSet to OpenShift
``` 
 ##  deploy smk-common-iac first
 $ git clone https://github.com/bcgov/smk-common-iac.git
 $ cd smk-common-iac/openshift
 $ oc create -f iac-core.yaml
 ## wait till completion 
 $ oc create -f smk-base.yaml
 ## once core and base image creation completed, you can now deploy to production ready cluster, 
 ## following sample is for bcparks QA site
 ## cleanup previous creation
 $ oc process -f smk-site-deployment-template.yaml \
   SITE_NAME=bcparks \
   SITE_REPO="https://github.com/bcgov/smk-bcparks.git" \
   REPO_BRANCH=qa WEBHOOK_PATH="/webhook" | oc delete -f -
 ## install after cleanup
 $ oc process -f smk-site-deployment-template.yaml \
   SITE_NAME=bcparks \
   SITE_REPO="https://github.com/bcgov/smk-bcparks.git" \
   REPO_BRANCH=qa WEBHOOK_PATH="/webhook" | oc create -f - 
 ## for HTTP only site run following  
 $ oc expose svc/smk-bcparks --hostname=bcparks.apps.gov.bc.ca
 ## for HTTPS only site run following
 $ oc create route edge --service=smk-bcparks --hostname=bcparks.apps.gov.bc.ca
 ## Optional Steps
 ### get the secrets from secreteMap, and setup github Webhook, 
 ### now you will have auto update from git Repo to running site alive
```
